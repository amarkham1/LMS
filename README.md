# Lease Management System

This is a full-stack Javascript web-based app which enables its users - predominantly commercial real estate brokers and landlords - to manage and track the status of current lease transactions within the portfolio. While the project is largely incomplete, users can register and log in/out of the system; view current ongoing deals with tenants; and dive into those deals, adding in Negotiation Details as the negotiation progresses and counter-offers are made.
